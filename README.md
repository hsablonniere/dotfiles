# My Dotfiles

Welcome to my personal dotfiles repository!
This repository contains configuration files for various command-line tools and development environments that I use daily.
Each tool has its own directory with its configuration files organized following the standard `~/.config/` directory structure.

## Overview

This repository is organized as a collection of tool-specific directories, each containing configuration files that should be symlinked or copied to their respective locations in your home directory.

## Tools & Configurations

## Management via Stow

This repository uses [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage symlinks.
Stow is a package management tool that creates symlinks from a source directory to a target directory, making it easy to manage dotfiles across multiple tools.

It creates symlinks from files in each tool's directory to your home directory (`~`), preserving the directory structure.
For example:

- `fish/.config/fish/conf.d/` → `~/.config/fish/conf.d/`
- `git/.gitconfig` → `~/.gitconfig`
- `starship/.config/starship.toml` → `~/.config/starship.toml`

This means you can:

- Keep all configurations version-controlled in one place
- Easily update tools by pulling the latest from this repository
- Manage multiple tools with a single command
- Install/uninstall tools without manual cleanup
